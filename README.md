## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) (to compile SCSS to CSS)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/itzaRinna/landingCafeShop.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd source
   ```

## Usage

To start the project locally, you can simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Building CSS

If you make changes to the SCSS files, you need to compile them to CSS. You can use the Sass command line tool:

```sh
sass styles/style.scss styles/style.css
```

This command compiles the SCSS file into the CSS file. You may also use a watch flag to automatically compile the SCSS file when changes are made:

```sh
sass --watch styles/style.scss:styles/style.css
```
